= OAuth.net 0.7.1.0=

===5th August 2009==
*Breaking Changes*

The Consumer class has been modified to now accept a new EndPoint for the access and request token endpoint urls, as well as the protected resource url.  This allows you to provide different HTTP methods for each endpoint.  Overloaded constructors are provided to maintain backwards compatability.

*Non-breaking changes*

  * Changes to the IRequestIDValidator to include the token in the method
  * Added additional parse method to OAuthParameters to allow a name value collection to be directly parsed
  * Added new OAuthRequestException and modified the OAuthPipelineModule to catch uncaught exceptions and stream them correctly to the client
  * Added IsOAuthRequest property to OAuthRequestcontext to be able to deetermine in the Service Provider if the context is valid.
  * Fixed error where AuthHeader Params were not being Rfc2986 decoded
  * Fixed passing of token to consumer callback store
  * Changed OAuthRequestContext to return the RequestToken from the Accesstoken if it has not been set previously
  * Fixed Issue [17|http://code.google.com/p/oauth-dot-net/issues/detail?id=17]
  * Fixed issues with equality implementations [Issue 18|http://code.google.com/p/oauth-dot-net/issues/detail?id=18]
  * Changed OAuthRequest to stop the workflow if no verifier is present when getting the AccessToken.


= OAuth.net 0.7.0.0=

===18th June 2009==
*Breaking Changes*

The Consumer and Service Provider classes have both been updated to implement the [http://oauth.net/core/1.0a OAuth Core 1.0 Rev A specification].  The implementation will not support OAuth Core 1.0 requests.

Consumer:

 * The consumer requests classes now support HTTP GET, POST, PUT and DELETE methods for the resource calls.



= OAuth.net 0.6.0.0=

===9th April 2009==
*Breaking Changes*

The method of loading components was changed from a hard reliance on the Castle Windsor IoC to implement the Microsoft Common Service Locator instead.  This is a breaking change to the configuration of your applications and application initialization.

Consumer:                

 * OAuthService no longer takes the config section to load Castle from; 
  * instead uses ServiceLocator.Current (overloads allow you to specify a different ServiceLocatorProvider)

 * Applications should set ServiceLocator.Current on startup 
  * i.e. in Global.asax as per example apps

 * Custom config section no longer used; 
  * use whatever registration mechanism your ServiceLocator supports. 
  * For Windsor, this just means changing the section type (and optionally name). 
  * Examples use Windsor with section name “oauth.net.components” 

Service Provider:

 * ServiceProviderContext: uses ServiceLocator.Currrent rather than ServiceLocator property

 * Applications must register ServiceLocator.Current on startup
  * i.e. in Global.asax as per example apps

 * Windsor config section called “oauth.net.serviceprovider” no longer used (conflicting breaking change).
  * Use whatever registration mechanism your ServiceLocator supports
  * Examples use Windsor with section name “oauth.net.components”

 * ComponentsSection attribute removed from settings section as this is no longer the registration mechanism

 * Settings section renamed from "OAuthServiceProvider" to "oauth.net.serviceprovider" (to be consistent with framework)
